## Introduction: Your Journey into Workflow Automation

Welcome to the world of automation! In today's digital landscape, we are constantly juggling tasks between different applications: updating a spreadsheet when a new email arrives, notifying a Slack channel about a new customer, generating reports from a database. These repetitive tasks, while necessary, consume valuable time and energy. This is where workflow automation platforms come in, and n8n stands out as a uniquely powerful and flexible option.

## What is n8n? A Simple Analogy

Imagine you have a collection of digital Lego blocks. Each block represents a specific application or service you use daily—like Gmail, Google Sheets, Slack, Twitter, or even complex AI models from OpenAI. n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n") is the board and the instruction manual that lets you connect these blocks together to build amazing things.

Instead of writing complex code, you use n8n's visual, node-based interface. A "node" is just one of those Lego blocks. You drag and drop nodes onto a canvas and draw lines between them to create a "workflow." This workflow is essentially a flowchart for your automated task. For example, a simple workflow could be:

1. **Trigger Node**: "When a new email with 'Invoice' in the subject arrives in my Gmail..."
2. **Action Node**: "...take the attached PDF..."
3. **Action Node**: "...extract the text from it..."
4. **Action Node**: "...and add a new row to my 'Invoices' Google Sheet with the sender's name and the invoice amount."

This ability to visually map out processes makes automation accessible to everyone, from marketers and business owners to developers. While it's a "low-code" platform, it also allows for custom code snippets and API calls, giving it immense depth for complex, tailor-made solutions.

## Why Self-Host? The Power of Control and Cost-Effectiveness

n8n offers a convenient, paid Cloud service where they handle all the setup and maintenance for you. So, why would you want to host it yourself? The answer lies in three key benefits: cost, control, and flexibility.

Self-hosting puts you in the driver's seat of your automation infrastructure. It's the difference between renting an apartment and owning a house—both give you a place to live, but ownership provides far greater freedom.

### Key Benefits:

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: The most significant advantage. Self-hosting n8n can be virtually free (if run on your existing computer) or significantly cheaper than the official cloud plans, especially as your usage grows.

- **Full Control and Data Privacy**: When you self-host, your data never leaves your infrastructure. Your workflows, your credentials, and the data that passes through them reside on your machine or your private cloud server.

- **Unlimited Flexibility**: Self-hosted n8n has no artificial limits. You can create as many workflows and run them as many times as you want. The only constraints are the processing power (CPU) and memory (RAM) of the machine you're running it on.

## Overview of Self-Hosting Paths

This guide will walk you through the two primary and most practical paths for self-hosting n8n:

1. **Local Hosting with Docker**: Running n8n directly on your personal computer (Windows or Mac). Perfect for learning, developing, and testing workflows.

2. **Cloud Hosting with Railway**: When your automations are critical and need to run 24/7, you'll want to host n8n in the cloud. This ensures your workflows are always on, even when your computer is off.

## Part 1: Local Installation with Docker (The Recommended Start)

### Why Docker? Your App in a Box

Docker packages an application (like n8n) along with everything it needs to run—the code, libraries, system tools, and settings—into a single, neat package called an "image." You can then run this image inside a "container" on any computer that has Docker installed.

#### Pros of using Docker for n8n:
- **Easy Installation & Management**: Once Docker is set up, running n8n is as simple as a single command
- **System Isolation**: The n8n container is isolated from your main operating system
- **Consistency**: An n8n setup with Docker works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux

#### Cons of a local Docker setup:
- **Requires Your Computer to Be On**: Your automations will only run when your computer is on
- **Webhooks Need Extra Setup**: By default, your local n8n instance is not accessible from the internet

### System Requirements

| Operating System | Minimum Requirements | Recommended Specifications |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Windows** | Windows 10/11 (64-bit), 4GB RAM, 2GB free disk space, PowerShell 5.1+ | 8GB+ RAM, 4-core+ CPU, SSD Storage |
| **macOS** | macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or newer, 4GB RAM, 2GB free disk space | 8GB+ RAM (M1/M2 Mac highly recommended), SSD Storage |

### Step-by-Step Guide: Installing Docker

#### For Windows Users:

1. **Download Docker Desktop**: Go to [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. **Run the Installer**: Open the downloaded file (requires administrator privileges)
3. **Enable WSL 2**: Make sure the "WSL 2 backend" option is checked
4. **System Restart**: Restart your computer after installation

If WSL 2 is not installed, enable it manually:
```powershell
wsl --install
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

#### For Mac Users:

1. **Download Docker Desktop**: Go to [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. **Choose the Correct Version**: Select the right version for your Mac's processor (Intel or Apple Silicon)
3. **Install the Application**: Open the .dmg file and drag Docker to Applications folder
4. **Run Docker**: Open Docker from Applications folder

Alternative (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

### Step-by-Step Guide: Launching n8n with Docker

1. **Create a Dedicated Folder**:

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
mkdir C:\n8n-docker
cd C:\n8n-docker
```

Mac (Terminal):
```bash
mkdir ~/n8n-docker
cd ~/n8n-docker
```

2. **Create the `docker-compose.yml` file**:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n:latest
    container_name: n8n
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    environment:
      # 기본 설정
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=admin123
      
      # 외부 접속 허용
      - N8N_HOST=0.0.0.0
      - N8N_PORT=5678
      - N8N_PROTOCOL=http
      
      # 웹훅 설정
      - WEBHOOK_URL=https://voted-statutory-processor-matthew.trycloudflare.com
      
      # 데이터 지속성
      - N8N_USER_FOLDER=/home/node/.n8n
      
      # AI 모델 연동을 위한 설정
      - N8N_AI_ENABLED=true
      
      # 시간대 설정
      - TZ=Asia/Seoul
      
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    
    # LM Studio와 통신을 위한 네트워크 설정
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"

volumes:
  n8n_data:
    driver: local

networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge

```

3. **Launch n8n**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. **Access n8n**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5678`

## Part 2: Connecting Your Local n8n to the World with Webhooks

### What is a Webhook and Why Do I Need This?

A webhook is a special, unique "phone number" (a URL) for your n8n workflow. Other applications can "call" this number to send you data instantly when an event happens.

The problem: Your local n8n instance lives at `http://localhost:5678`, which is only accessible from your computer. To receive webhooks, you need a public address.

### Method 1: Temporary Public URL with Cloudflare (For Testing)

1. **Install `cloudflared` command-line tool**:

Mac (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

Windows (Winget):
```powershell
winget install --id Cloudflare.cloudflared
```

2. **Create the Tunnel**:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5678
```

3. **Configure n8n with the New URL**:

Stop your current n8n container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

Edit your `docker-compose.yml` and add the WEBHOOK_URL:
```yaml
environment:
  - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=America/New_York
  - WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-tunnel-url.trycloudflare.com # Replace with actual URL
```

Start n8n again:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Method 2: Permanent Custom Domain with Cloudflare (For Production Use)

1. **Get a Domain and Link to Cloudflare**:
   - Purchase a domain from a registrar
   - Create a free Cloudflare account
   - Add your domain to Cloudflare

2. **Create a Persistent Tunnel**:
```bash
cloudflared login
cloudflared tunnel create n8n-tunnel
```

3. **Configure the Tunnel**:

Create `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:
```yaml
tunnel: n8n-tunnel
credentials-file: /path/to/your/tunnel_id.json
ingress:
  - hostname: n8n.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:5678
  - service: http_status:404
```

4. **Link DNS and Run the Tunnel**:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns n8n-tunnel n8n.yourdomain.com
cloudflared tunnel run n8n-tunnel
```

5. **Update n8n Configuration**:
```yaml
environment:
  - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=America/New_York
  - WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.yourdomain.com
```

## Part 4: Advanced Local Installation with npm (For Developers)

### Who is this for?

This method is for:
- **Node.js Developers**: Those comfortable with Node.js ecosystem
- **Customizers and Contributors**: Those wanting to modify n8n source code

⚠️ **Note**: For beginners, we strongly recommend the Docker installation.

### Prerequisites: Installing Node.js & npm

#### For Windows:
1. Go to [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the LTS version
3. Run the .msi installer

#### For Mac:
We recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager):

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20
```

#### Verify Installation:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installing and Running n8n via npm

```bash
npm install -g n8n
```

2. **Start n8n**:
```bash
n8n start
```

3. **Access n8n**: Go to `http://localhost:5678`

#### Additional Commands:

Run on different port:
```bash
n8n start --port 5679
```

Run in background (Mac/Linux):
```bash
nohup n8n start > n8n.log 2>&1 &
```

## Part 5: Troubleshooting Common Problems

### General Approach to Troubleshooting

1. **Check the Logs**:
   - Docker: `docker-compose logs n8n`
   - npm: Check terminal output or log file
   - Railway: Check "Deploy Logs" in dashboard

2. **Restart Everything**:
   - Docker: `docker-compose down` then `docker-compose up -d`
   - npm: Ctrl+C then `n8n start`

### Problem 1: Port Conflict ("Port is already allocated")

**Symptoms**: Error about port 5678 being in use

**Solutions**:

Find and stop conflicting process:

Windows:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5678
taskkill /PID [PID] /F
```

Mac/Linux:
```bash
lsof -i :5678
kill -9 [PID]
```

Or change n8n port:
- Docker: Change `"5678:5678"` to `"5679:5678"` in docker-compose.yml
- npm: Use `n8n start --port 5679`

### Problem 2: Permission Errors

**Windows**: Enable script execution:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Mac**: Use nvm to avoid permission issues, or fix npm permissions:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}
```

### Problem 3: Firewall Blocking Access

**Windows**: Add firewall rule:
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "n8n Allow HTTP" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5678
```

**Mac**: Check System Settings > Network > Firewall and add exception

### Problem 4: Docker/npm Environment Issues

**Docker**:
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Restart Docker Desktop
- Clean up: `docker system prune`

**npm**:
- Clear cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Reinstall Node.js if necessary
